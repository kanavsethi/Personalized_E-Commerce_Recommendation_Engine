Personalized E-Commerce Recommendation Engine

According to reports, 35% of Amazon’s revenue is generated by its recommendation engine. Developed a E-Commerce Platform Product Recommendation System consisting of 8 different recommendation modules. Each module has been made into a microservice following the service-oriented architecture. We ingest data from the client, train different ML models and save them as HDF5 files. Whenever the client requests the microservice, our web application, will access these files and based on the arguments in the request, generate recommendations and send the response to the customer. To create a more scalable solution, the Recommendation Engine has been containerized using Docker.   The recommendation engine contains RESTful POST API’s developed in Python’s Flask for data ingestion as well as serving recommendations.  In order to be able to handle high loads in production, we have deployed the Recommendation Engine behind a Gunicorn WSGI web server with is served by a Nginx Reverse proxy for load balancing. The Engine also contained a Queue based Mechanism for Ingestion of Real-time data from clients.
